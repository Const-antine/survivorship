Here is an Even rule in a JSON format which I have used in my case. As "instance-id", feel free to specify the instances which should be running all the time. Once any of them is terminated, the lambda function will be invoked and it will create a whole new architecture in another ( "safe") region. Then, you may switch a Route53 for example to a new location and all the systems will be "alive" again. 

Also, you will need to specify a lambda function as a target for this event in Cloudwatch


{
  "source": [
    "aws.ec2"
  ],
  "detail-type": [
    "EC2 Instance State-change Notification"
  ],
  "detail": {
    "state": [
      "terminated"
    ],
    "instance-id": [
      "123456",
      "654321",
      "321456"
    ]
  }
}
